# My First Angular App
 Hi there. This is my first Angular App under the supervision of SugarLabs.

# How do you view my work ?
 Simple. Clone the directory or download it. To clone it, we use the command.

## Cloning the Repo
 ```
git clone https://github.com/Youngestdev/AngularApp.git

```
## Downloading 
 use the url below
 ```
 https://github.com/Youngestdev/AngularApp/archive/master.zip

 ```

 ## After all these steps, what do i do next ?
 Okay, cool. We navigate into the folder *I'm using a Unix OS* .using the command ``` cd AngularApp ```  and use the command  ``` ng serve ```.

 ## Wow.. ! How can i build mine ?
 If you are a total beginner. Head  straight to <a href="https://codeacademy.com">CodeAcademy</a> and learn Javascript , Html and Css, then take the Angular courses or Use <a href="https://youtube.com"> YouTube </a> to your advantage or use the best teacher <a href="https://google.com">Google</a>
